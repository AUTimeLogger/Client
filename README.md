This is a frontend application for the AUTimeLogger working hours logging system using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

To run the application, the following is required:

- node (tested with `v16.15.0`)
- yarn (tested with `1.22.5`)

## ⏳ Installation

First, set up a development `.env.local` file with the following values:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCKING=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8090/api
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=REBk6KFONys1Z73ktmIiAgeyXt3MUpiLsZkYf4IqWIQ=
```

> Upon deployment, a new secret should be generated, and the `NEXTAUTH_URL` value should be replaced to point to the deployment URL.
> A new secret can easily be generated using the following command:
>
> ```
> openssl rand -base64 32
> ```

Then run the following installation command from the root directory:

```bash
yarn install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

#### Docker

To ship the application using Docker, run the following commands:

```bash
# Builds the docker image
docker build -t nextjs-docker .

# Runs the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 nextjs-docker
```
